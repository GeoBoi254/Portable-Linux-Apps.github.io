# FALKON

 Falkon is a new and very fast Qt web browser. It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms. This project has been originally started only for educational purposes. But from its start, Falkon has grown into a feature-rich browser.

 Falkon has all standard functions you expect from a web browser. It includes bookmarks, history (both also in sidebar) and tabs. Above that, you can manage RSS feeds with an included RSS reader, block ads with a built-in AdBlock plugin, block Flash content with Click2Flash and edit the local CA Certificates database with an SSL manager.
